TODO
 * should include *.pyc/*pyc of the main pm_logconv.py?
 * should rename the module name to pm_logconv? (without "_cs")
 * test both on RHEL6/RHEL7
 * test when sosreport is not installed
 * collecting ha-log is enough?
   * from when? enough old? rotated log? how determined?
 * need other logs?
   * logrotate.d/syslog, rsyslog.conf, journal.conf, etc.
   * if any, move the sosreport plugin into pm_extras and add them accordingly
 * Finalize; remove this TODO file and squash commits to merge
